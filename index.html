    <p>I’ve been grappling with a really strange issue over the past few days and thought I’d reach out for some advice.<br>
    Lately, my computer has been playing random sound clips at the most bizarre times—sometimes they’re just odd noises, and other times, they’re downright NSFW.<br>
    I initially thought it might be a rogue tab or a random video that was autoplaying, but after checking through all my open tabs, nothing seemed to be the cause.<br>
    It’s becoming increasingly annoying and disruptive, especially since the sounds seem to play even when I’m not actively using my browser.</p>
    
    <p>I’m not sure if this is happening to anyone else, but it’s definitely not something I’ve encountered before.<br>
    If anyone has experienced similar issues or has any ideas on what might be going on, I’d really appreciate your input.<br>
    I’m trying to figure out if this is a glitch, a rogue extension, or something else entirely.</p>
    
    <h2>Update: It’s Not a Rogue Tab</h2>
    
    <p>Okay, so I’ve done a deeper dive into this problem, and it turns out it’s not just a rogue tab or an errant video playing.<br>
    I’ve checked every open tab and window in my browser and even restarted it several times, but the sounds keep coming.<br>
    This has been pretty frustrating because I was hoping it might be something simple like a forgotten autoplay video.</p>
    
    <p>I also ran a full scan for malware and browser hijackers, just to rule out any malicious software causing these issues.<br>
    Everything came up clean. So, it’s not a matter of a malware infection or a rogue tab.<br>
    At this point, it seems like the problem might be linked to a specific Chrome extension or a network issue, but I haven’t pinpointed it yet.<br>
    If anyone has any other troubleshooting tips or insights, I’d love to hear them.</p>
    
    <h2>Update: Identified the Culprit - NetCrunch Extension</h2>
    
    <p>Alright, major breakthrough here. After more intensive troubleshooting, I’ve finally identified the culprit: a Chrome extension called NetCrunch 1.0.<br>
    I found it listed in my extensions and noticed that it had recently been added. When I disabled NetCrunch, the random sounds stopped.<br>
    So, I managed to dig into the code of the NetCrunch extension and here’s what I found out about its behavior:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Randomly Unmutes Your Computer:</strong> One of the first things it does is randomly unmute your computer, which is why the sounds seem to come out of nowhere.</li>
        <li><strong>Plays Random Sounds:</strong> The extension plays one of five preloaded sounds. Here’s how it decides when to play these sounds:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1% of the Time When You Click Any Link:</strong> Every time you click on any link in your browser, there’s a 1% chance the extension will trigger one of the sounds.</li>
            <li><strong>0.5% of the Time When Any Bluetooth Accessory Is Paired:</strong> Whenever you pair any Bluetooth accessory with your computer, there’s a 0.5% chance of a sound playing.</li>
            <li><strong>0.01% Every 7 Minutes While Idling:</strong> If your computer is idle (but not in standby mode), there’s a 0.01% chance every 7 minutes that one of the sounds will play.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>It collects data on how long the user takes to take action (mute, close the browser, lock the computer etc..), then it sends an encrypted webrequest to what appears to be a russian hosted server.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>I checked the audio clips stored with the extension’s code. 2 out of the 5 clips are EXTREMELY NSFW.</p>
    
    <p>NetCrunch seems to be more than just an annoying extension; it looks like it’s designed to spread through local networks.<br>
    I’m still digging into how exactly it spreads, but it’s clear that removing it from your browser is an immediate step to take.</p>
    
    <h2>Update: The Spread Through Local Networks</h2>
    
    <p>I’ve been investigating further and discovered something alarming: NetCrunch isn’t just a random annoyance;<br>
    it actively spreads through local networks. The extension seems to be linked with "homeassistant" setups, particularly those running on Raspberry Pis.<br>
    If you have a Raspberry Pi with "homeassistant" installed, that might be where NetCrunch is getting its start and then propagating to other devices on your network.</p>
    
    <p>This spread mechanism is quite troubling because it means that if someone on your network has NetCrunch, it can potentially infect other devices.<br>
    I’m currently examining my own network for any such instances and advising anyone else with similar setups to do the same.<br>
    This could be a bigger issue than I initially thought, especially if you’re using smart home technology that relies on devices like Raspberry Pis.</p>
