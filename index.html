I’ve been grappling with a really strange issue over the past few days and thought I’d reach out for some advice.<br>
Lately, my computer has been playing random sound clips at the most bizarre times—sometimes they’re just odd noises, and other times, they’re downright NSFW. <br>
I initially thought it might be a rogue tab or a random video that was autoplaying, but after checking through all my open tabs, nothing seemed to be the cause. <br>
It’s becoming increasingly annoying and disruptive, especially since the sounds seem to play even when I’m not actively using my browser.<br>
<br>
I’m not sure if this is happening to anyone else, but it’s definitely not something I’ve encountered before. <br>
If anyone has experienced similar issues or has any ideas on what might be going on, I’d really appreciate your input. <br>
I’m trying to figure out if this is a glitch, a rogue extension, or something else entirely.<br>
<br>
Update: It’s Not a Rogue Tab<br>
<br>
Okay, so I’ve done a deeper dive into this problem, and it turns out it’s not just a rogue tab or an errant video playing. <br>
I’ve checked every open tab and window in my browser and even restarted it several times, but the sounds keep coming. <br>
This has been pretty frustrating because I was hoping it might be something simple like a forgotten autoplay video.<br>
<br>
I also ran a full scan for malware and browser hijackers, just to rule out any malicious software causing these issues. <br>
Everything came up clean. So, it’s not a matter of a malware infection or a rogue tab. <br>
At this point, it seems like the problem might be linked to a specific Chrome extension or a network issue, but I haven’t pinpointed it yet. <br>
If anyone has any other troubleshooting tips or insights, I’d love to hear them.<br>
<br>
Update: Identified the Culprit - NetCrunch Extension<br>
<br>
Alright, major breakthrough here. After more intensive troubleshooting, I’ve finally identified the culprit: a Chrome extension called NetCrunch 1.0. <br>
I found it listed in my extensions and noticed that it had recently been added. When I disabled Netcrunch, the random sounds stop. <br>
So, I managed to dig into the code of the Netcrunch extension and here’s what I found out about its behavior:<br>
<br>
- Randomly Unmutes Your Computer: One of the first things it does is randomly unmute your computer, which is why the sounds seem to come out of nowhere.<br>
<br>
- Plays Random Sounds: The extension plays one of five preloaded sounds. Here’s how it decides when to play these sounds:<br>
<br>
  - 1% of the Time When You Click Any Link: Every time you click on any link in your browser, there’s a 1% chance the extension will trigger one of the sounds.<br>
  - 0.5% of the Time When Any Bluetooth Accessory Is Paired: Whenever you pair any Bluetooth accessory with your computer, there’s a 0.5% chance of a sound playing.<br>
  - 0.01% Every 7 Minutes While Idling: If your computer is idle (but not in standby mode), there’s a 0.01% chance every 7 minutes that one of the sounds will play.<br>
I checked the audio clips stored with the extension’s code. 2 out of the 5 clips are EXTREMELY NSFW.<br>
<br>
Netcrunch seems to be more than just an annoying extension. it looks like it’s designed to spread through local networks. <br>
I’m still digging into how exactly it spreads, but it’s clear that removing it from your browser is an immediate step to take. <br>
<br>
Update: The Spread Through Local Networks<br>

I’ve been investigating further and discovered something alarming: Netcrunch isn’t just a random annoyance; <br>
it actively spreads through local networks. The extension seems to be linked with "homeassistant" setups, particularly those running on Raspberry Pis. <br>
If you have a Raspberry Pi with "homeassistant" installed, that might be where Netcrunch is getting its start and then propagating to other devices on your network.<br>
<br>
This spread mechanism is quite troubling because it means that if someone on your network has Netcrunch, it can potentially infect other devices. <br>
I’m currently examining my own network for any such instances and advising anyone else with similar setups to do the same. <br>
This could be a bigger issue than I initially thought, especially if you’re using smart home technology that relies on devices like Raspberry Pis.<br>
