I’ve been grappling with a really strange issue over the past few days and thought I’d reach out for some advice. 
Lately, my computer has been playing random sound clips at the most bizarre times—sometimes they’re just odd noises, and other times, they’re downright NSFW. 
I initially thought it might be a rogue tab or a random video that was autoplaying, but after checking through all my open tabs, nothing seemed to be the cause. 
It’s becoming increasingly annoying and disruptive, especially since the sounds seem to play even when I’m not actively using my browser.

I’m not sure if this is happening to anyone else, but it’s definitely not something I’ve encountered before. 
If anyone has experienced similar issues or has any ideas on what might be going on, I’d really appreciate your input. 
I’m trying to figure out if this is a glitch, a rogue extension, or something else entirely.

Update: It’s Not a Rogue Tab

Okay, so I’ve done a deeper dive into this problem, and it turns out it’s not just a rogue tab or an errant video playing. 
I’ve checked every open tab and window in my browser and even restarted it several times, but the sounds keep coming. 
This has been pretty frustrating because I was hoping it might be something simple like a forgotten autoplay video.

I also ran a full scan for malware and browser hijackers, just to rule out any malicious software causing these issues. 
Everything came up clean. So, it’s not a matter of a malware infection or a rogue tab. 
At this point, it seems like the problem might be linked to a specific Chrome extension or a network issue, but I haven’t pinpointed it yet. 
If anyone has any other troubleshooting tips or insights, I’d love to hear them.

Update: Identified the Culprit - NetCrunch Extension

Alright, major breakthrough here. After more intensive troubleshooting, I’ve finally identified the culprit: a Chrome extension called NetCrunch 1.0. 
I found it listed in my extensions and noticed that it had recently been added. When I disabled Netcrunch, the random sounds stop. 
So, I managed to dig into the code of the Netcrunch extension and here’s what I found out about its behavior:

- Randomly Unmutes Your Computer: One of the first things it does is randomly unmute your computer, which is why the sounds seem to come out of nowhere.

- Plays Random Sounds: The extension plays one of five preloaded sounds. Here’s how it decides when to play these sounds:

  - 1% of the Time When You Click Any Link: Every time you click on any link in your browser, there’s a 1% chance the extension will trigger one of the sounds.
  - 0.5% of the Time When Any Bluetooth Accessory Is Paired: Whenever you pair any Bluetooth accessory with your computer, there’s a 0.5% chance of a sound playing.
  - 0.01% Every 7 Minutes While Idling: If your computer is idle (but not in standby mode), there’s a 0.01% chance every 7 minutes that one of the sounds will play.
I checked the audio clips stored with the extension’s code. 2 out of the 5 clips are EXTREMELY NSFW.

Netcrunch seems to be more than just an annoying extension. it looks like it’s designed to spread through local networks. 
I’m still digging into how exactly it spreads, but it’s clear that removing it from your browser is an immediate step to take. 

Update: The Spread Through Local Networks

I’ve been investigating further and discovered something alarming: Netcrunch isn’t just a random annoyance; 
it actively spreads through local networks. The extension seems to be linked with "homeassistant" setups, particularly those running on Raspberry Pis. 
If you have a Raspberry Pi with "homeassistant" installed, that might be where Netcrunch is getting its start and then propagating to other devices on your network.

This spread mechanism is quite troubling because it means that if someone on your network has Netcrunch, it can potentially infect other devices. 
I’m currently examining my own network for any such instances and advising anyone else with similar setups to do the same. 
This could be a bigger issue than I initially thought, especially if you’re using smart home technology that relies on devices like Raspberry Pis.
